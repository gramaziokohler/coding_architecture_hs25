### Design Project

In this final assignment, you will integrate all the concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive building structure. Using Python programming, you will create a building that incorporates architectural components such as slabs, columns, and facade walls, sculpted by a filter class.

Your building will be placed in a real location in the city of Zurich. You can choose one of the following five plot locations for your design project: **Altstetten**, **Hardturm**, **Letzi**, **Heinrich-Areal**, or **Escher Wyss**. Each location has unique characteristics and potential constraints, so consider factors like plot size, shape, and local context when making your choice.
